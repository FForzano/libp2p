This is a simplified implementation of a Napster node.
For use this you have to open the napsternode.py file and set the address and port of the 
centralized directory server of the net (in the relative variables).

To start the command-line node tool write:
>>> python3 napsternode.py IPP2Pv4 IPP2Pv6 PP2P

where:
 - IPP2Pv4 is the IPv4 address on which you can transmit files (your own IPv4 address)
 - IPP2Pv6 is the IPv6 address on which you can transmit files (your own IPv6 address)
 - PP2P is the port on which you can accept connection for transmit files (free choise)
